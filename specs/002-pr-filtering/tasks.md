# Tasks: PR Filtering

**Feature**: Add filtering capabilities to the PR list (fuzzy search + persistent structured filters)  
**Branch**: `002-pr-filtering`  
**Input**: [plan.md](plan.md), [spec.md](spec.md), [data-model.md](data-model.md), [contracts/protocols.md](contracts/protocols.md)

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - tests included as part of implementation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- File paths follow Swift Package structure under `app/GitReviewItApp/`

---

**Checkpoint**: Infrastructure verified - foundational work can begin

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Fuzzy Search PRs (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to quickly find specific PRs by typing parts of the title, repository name, or author name with fuzzy matching and ranked results

**Independent Test**: Enter various search queries and verify matching PRs appear in ranked order. Search is transient (doesn't persist across launches). Delivers value without structured filters.

**Acceptance Criteria from Spec**:
- Search "fix bug" shows PRs with "fix" or "bug" in title, ranked by match quality
- Search "api-service" shows PRs from repositories containing "api-service" at top
- Search "john" shows PRs by "johnsmith" ranked by name match quality  
- Clear search box shows all PRs immediately
- Search doesn't persist on app relaunch
- Empty search results show "No PRs match your search"

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Filter by Organization and Repository (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to filter PRs by organization or repository with persistent selections that survive app restarts

- Combine org "CompanyA" + repo "api-backend" shows only CompanyA/api-backend PRs
- Filters persist across app restarts
- Clear individual filters works
- Empty filter results show "No PRs match your current filters" with clear option

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Filter by Team (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to filter PRs by GitHub team with graceful degradation when team data unavailable due to permissions

**Independent Test**: Select team filters (when available) and verify correct filtering. Test graceful degradation when team API fails or permissions missing. Other filters continue working.

**Acceptance Criteria from Spec**:
- Select "Backend Team" from team filter shows only Backend Team repos' PRs
- Combine team filters with org/repo filters (all active filters apply)
- Team filter marked unavailable when missing permissions with explanation
- Team filter shows error state on API failure but other filters work
- When team data unavailable, org and repo filters continue working
- Saved team filter auto-cleared on relaunch if team data unavailable with notice

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 complete - team filtering functional with graceful degradation

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Combine Search and Filters (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enable users to combine fuzzy search with structured filters for powerful filtering workflows (intersection of results)

**Independent Test**: Apply search queries along with org/repo/team filters and verify both apply correctly (AND logic). Clearing search leaves filters active, clearing filters leaves search active.

**Acceptance Criteria from Spec**:
- Filter by org "CompanyA" + search "bug fix" shows only CompanyA PRs matching "bug fix"
- Search "api" + repo filter "backend-service" shows only backend-service PRs matching "api"
- Clear search leaves structured filters active
- Clear filters leaves search query active
- Combined empty results show "No PRs match your search and filters" with adjustment options

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T056 [US4] Add clearSearchQuery method to FilterState and wire to UI in app/GitReviewItApp/Sources/GitReviewItApp/Features/PullRequests/State/FilterState.swift
- [ ] T057 [US4] Manual test: Verify search + filter combinations work, clearing search leaves filters, clearing filters leaves search, empty states accurate

**Checkpoint**: User Story 4 complete - all filtering features integrated and working together

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final improvements affecting multiple user stories

- [ ] T058 [P] Create test fixture with 500 PRs in app/GitReviewItApp/Tests/GitReviewItAppTests/Fixtures/prs-with-varied-data.json
- [ ] T059 Performance test: Measure filtering time with 500 PR dataset (must be <500ms)
- [ ] T060 Performance test: Verify search debouncing works smoothly (no perceived lag)
- [ ] T061 [P] Accessibility audit: Run VoiceOver and verify all filter controls have descriptive labels
- [ ] T062 Accessibility audit: Test keyboard navigation in FilterSheet
- [ ] T063 [P] Add inline documentation to FilterEngine, FuzzyMatcher, FilterState
- [ ] T064 Update README.md with PR filtering feature description and screenshots
- [ ] T065 Review all error messages for clarity and actionability
- [ ] T066 Final manual testing pass: All user scenarios from spec.md
- [ ] T067 Run just test to verify all tests pass
- [ ] T068 Run just lint to verify code style compliance
- [ ] T069 Validate quickstart.md implementation sequence matches actual implementation

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete, tested, documented, and ready for review

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - US1 (Phase 3): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (Phase 4): Can start after Foundational (builds on US1 but independently testable)
  - US3 (Phase 5): Can start after Foundational (builds on US1+US2 but independently testable)
  - US4 (Phase 6): Requires US1 and US2 complete (validates integration)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational (T003-T011)
- **US2 (P2)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational (T003-T011)
- **US3 (P3)**: Independent - only depends on Foundational (T003-T011)
- **US4 (P2)**: Depends on US1 (T012-T022) and US2 (T023-T038) - validates their integration

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Foundational Phase** (T003-T010):
- All tasks can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

**Within US1** (T012-T022):
- T012 (FuzzyMatcher impl) || T013 (FuzzyMatcher tests) - parallel

**Within US2** (T023-T038):
- T023 (FilterPersistence impl) || T024 (FilterPersistence tests) - parallel
- T026 (FilterEngine tests) can start once T025 (FilterEngine update) is done
- T030-T032 (FilterSheet creation) can happen in parallel with T027-T029 (FilterState updates)

**Within US3** (T039-T052):
- T039-T040 (GitHubAPI extension) || T041-T042 (tests + fixture) - parallel
- T043-T044 (FilterEngine team logic + tests) can happen in parallel
- T048 (FilterSheet team section) can happen independently

**Within Polish Phase** (T058-T069):
- T058 (fixture creation) || T061 (VoiceOver audit) || T063 (documentation) - all parallel

### MVP Recommendation

**Minimum Viable Product**: Phase 3 (User Story 1) only
