# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Sources: `GitReviewIt/` contains SwiftUI app code (`GitReviewItApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`).
- Assets: `GitReviewIt/Assets.xcassets/` for colors and app icons.
- Xcode Project: `GitReviewIt.xcodeproj/` manages targets and build settings.
- Automation & Specs: `.github/` (agents/prompts) and `.specify/` (templates, scripts) support planning and review workflows.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- **Justfile Available**: Use `just` to run common build commands. See `just --list` for all available commands.
- Quick build: `just build` (compiles the app).
- Clean build: `just clean-build` (removes artifacts and compiles fresh).
- Run tests: `just test` (when tests exist).
- Open in Xcode: `just open` or `open GitReviewIt.xcodeproj` (build and run with the default scheme).
- CLI build (manual): `xcodebuild -project GitReviewIt.xcodeproj -scheme GitReviewIt -destination 'platform=macOS' build` (compiles the app).
- CLI tests (manual): `xcodebuild -project GitReviewIt.xcodeproj -scheme GitReviewIt -destination 'platform=macOS' test`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: Swift (SwiftUI). Use 4-space indentation and limit line length to ~120 chars.
- Names: PascalCase for types, camelCase for variables/functions, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Files: One primary type per file; filename matches type name.
- Architecture: Prefer MVVM for features; keep views declarative and business logic in view models/services.
- Imports: Keep UI separated from domain logic; avoid unnecessary cross-layer dependencies.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: XCTest. Create a `GitReviewItTests` target mirroring app modules.
- Naming: `FeatureNameTests`, test methods start with `test...` and describe behavior (e.g., `testLoadingRecentCommitsDisplaysList`).
- Scope: Focus on view models and pure logic; UI verified via snapshots or previews as needed.
- Running: From Xcode’s Test action or the CLI command above.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Write imperative, scoped messages (e.g., `Add commit list view`). Keep changes focused and incremental.
- PRs: Include clear description, linked issues, and screenshots for UI changes. Add testing notes and risk assessment for non-trivial changes.
- Reviews: Address comments with follow-up commits; avoid force-push after reviews start unless requested.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Secrets: Do not commit tokens or credentials. Store GitHub tokens securely (e.g., macOS Keychain) and access via injected configuration.
- Info.plist is generated by the project; prefer build settings over manual plist edits where possible.

## Agent-Specific Notes
- The repository ships with Speckit prompts/templates (`.github`, `.specify`). Keep templates intact; add feature specs/plans under the provided structure when expanding the app.
